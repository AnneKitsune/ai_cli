# Ai Cli

Run AI from the cli using openai-compatible endpoints.
The AI is able to run commands on your computer.
--safe turns on prompting before running commands.
Conversations are erased every turn by default unless you use --continue.

The purpose of this tool is to quickly setup virtual machines/servers or have quick one-off conversations from the terminal without going to a web browser.
